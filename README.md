Mentofy Task

Hello! this is my Mentofy Internship Task Project
Due to the given time constraints i couldnt to add css elements to my project as i have my ISE first year exams going on currently.
I was able to build a login module, product catalogue and a cart module,
Given time i could apply the C-R-U-D operations on the cart module,But for now its just display and add only.


To start the project open cmd or terminal and go to  the location where you have saved the repository(the folder containing the manage.py file for the project) .
Start a virtual envornment (* I used pipenv but any virtaul enviornment is fine)
on your terminal type -> python manage.py createsuperuser 
this is to give you administrative priveledge over the project.
follow the instructions on your cmd screen.
once done go ahead and start a local server by typing this command in your cmd->python manage.py runserver
go to the following url->http://127.0.0.1:8000
this should produce the log in/log out/signup screen. however if you are aldready logged in please log out and log in once again as you will be redirected to the products page after logging in.
at the products page you can see two items Car1 and Car2.
go ahead and click on them to show you a detailed view.
after clicking on the product you will be shown a detailed view where you will be given an option to add product to cart
after adding products to cart you can visit the cart by clicking the link displaying 'Click to view cart'.
at the cart view you can see all the products listed in your cart.

this is a basic project to demonstrate a small sample of my basics with backend side of django web development.
given more time i could make a better project with more real world functionalities.
Thank you for giving me this Oppurtunity to perform the task for the internship as i have definitely learned a lot from this project
If you have any queries regarding operating the project or in general please feel free to contact me.
Thank you
